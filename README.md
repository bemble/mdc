## Workflow #1: bouncing balloons

The idea was to make quiet realistics bounces with balloons.

[Demo here](http://pierrecle.github.io/mdc/workshop1/)


## Workflow #2: AXA home


The aim was to get rid of loader. So, the loading starts when the interface zoom on the image and then color the rooms during a fake API call.
Once loaded, every rooms are colored.

## Workflow #3: VR mountains

We would like to tell a 3D story, but we had to try VR technology in web applications first. For time reason, just a 3D
landscape that moves with the phone.

**Note:** it requires a Google Cardboard and just a web browser to fully enjoy it.

[Demo here](http://pierrecle.github.io/mdc/workshop3/)

To try it locally, `npm install` and `npm start`.
